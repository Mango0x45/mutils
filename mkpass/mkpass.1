.Nm mkpass
.Nd generate random passwords
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar count
.Op Fl an
.Op Ar length
.Nm
.Fl m
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to randomly generate passwords.
The default program behavior when no options are specified is to print a single
50 character long password comprising of printable
.Xr ascii 7
characters.
On most Unix-like systems, the random characters are generated by reading from the
.Ar /dev/urandom
device.
On BSD systems the
.Fn arc4random_uniform
function will be used instead.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Generate passwords using only alphanumberic characters.
.It Fl c Ar count
Specify the number of passwords to generate.
If specified, each password will be printed on its own line.
The value given for
.Ar count
must be a non\-negative integer.
.It Fl m
Print the maximum supported value for
.Ar length
and
.Ar count
before exiting.
.It Fl n
Do not print a trailing newline.
If combined with the
.Fl c
flag, only the very last newline will be omitted.
This option can be useful in a pipe, such as perhaps piping to the clipboard with
.Xr xclip 1
or
.Xr xsel 1 .
